What is Postman+? <br/>
Postman+ is an API platform for building and using APIs. <br/>
Postman+ simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.

# Participate
Feel free to follow the OpenAPI, fork the collection, or leave a comment. I'm looking to keep making the OpenAPI more relevant, <br> while making the examples used to drive the mocks for robust, so please join in and help wherever you can.
